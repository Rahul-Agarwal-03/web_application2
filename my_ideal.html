        <p class="about">
            Ratan Naval Tata is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and a
            former chairman of Tata Sons. He was also chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim
            chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to head its charitable trusts. He is
            the recipient of two of the highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma Bhushan
            (2000).<br>
            <br>
            I am amazed by Ratan Tata Sir's perosnality, his down to earth nature, his business strategy and his life
            philosophy. I love his vision
            through which he not only continues to inspire his employees but also the youth. Ratan Sir is a great
            motivational speak and a philanthropist.
            He continues to support several young startups with his guidance and investment to give a kickstart to young
            startups and promote an
            entrepreneurial environment in the country.
